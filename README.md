**Canny Edge Detection** - Performed non-maximum suppression using gradient’s orientation and magnitude and tuned high and low edge thresholds to perform hysteresis to detect edges.

**Laplacian Blending** - Performed laplacian blending of two images by finding their gaussian pyramid and laplacian pyramid.

**Poisson Image Editing** - Created a blended image, partially cloned from an image, using Poisson’s equation. Mixed gradient of the images and performed texture flattening to get the desired blended image.

**Homography Estimation** - Estimated homography using RANSAC algorithm and performed image stitching by inverse warping.

**Image Morphing** - Image morphing was performed via Delaunay triangulation and the morph was animated by resizing and rescaling the images.
